# End of Week - Weekly Summary

Summarize the current week's daily entries into a cohesive Review section.

## Steps

1. **Find the current week's impact file** - Look in `~/Documents/life/work/impact/2026/MM/DD.md` where DD is the last workday of the current week.

2. **Read the file** - Look at all daily entries (Mon-Fri sections).

3. **Analyze and synthesize** the work:
   - Identify major themes/projects
   - Group related work across days
   - Note significant accomplishments
   - Identify patterns or focus areas

4. **Write the Review section** - Replace the Review section content with a digestible summary.

## Review Format

```markdown
## Review

**Major Focus Areas:**
- [Project/Theme]: Brief summary of what was accomplished
- [Another Area]: Summary

**Key Deliverables:**
- Specific thing shipped/completed
- Another deliverable

**Notes:**
- Any blockers, learnings, or context worth remembering
```

Keep it concise but capture the essence of the week. This is for future reference and potential quarterly/yearly rollups.
