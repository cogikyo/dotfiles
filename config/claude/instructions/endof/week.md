# End of Week - Weekly Summary

Summarize the current week's daily entries into a cohesive Review section.

## Steps

1. **Find the current week's impact file** - Look in `~/Documents/life/work/impact/2026/MM/DD.md` where DD is the last workday of the current week.

2. **Read the file** - Look at all daily entries (Mon-Fri sections).

3. **Analyze and synthesize** the work:
   - Identify major themes/projects
   - Group related work across days
   - Note significant accomplishments
   - Identify patterns or focus areas

4. **Write the Review section** - Replace the Review section content with a digestible summary.

## Review Format

Simple bullet points, grouped by project/area if the week touched multiple things.

```markdown
## Review

**Project Name**
- Brief action-oriented description of what was done
- Another thing accomplished
- Bug fixes, improvements, etc.

**Another Project** (if applicable)
- What was done here
```

Keep it simple and scannable. No rigid structure needed—just group related work and describe what happened. This is for future reference and potential quarterly/yearly rollups.
