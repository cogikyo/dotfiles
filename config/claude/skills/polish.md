# Polish

Multi-phase code refactoring workflow for Go and TypeScript/React.

**First, read full instructions:** `~/.claude/instructions/polish.md`

Then read language-specific patterns as needed:
- `~/.claude/instructions/polish/go.md`
- `~/.claude/instructions/polish/typescript.md`
- `~/.claude/instructions/polish/checklist.md`

## Modes

- `/polish` - Full 4-phase workflow
- `/polish quick` - Lightweight single-agent pass
